# Dice Game

Welcome to the Dice Game! This is a simple web-based game where two players roll dice, and the winner is determined based on the numbers rolled.

## How to Play

1. Open the [Dice Game](https://sramakrishnaa.github.io/Dice-Game/) in your web browser.
2. When the page loads, two dice will be rolled automatically.
3. The number on the first dice will be compared to the number on the second dice to determine the winner:
   - If the number on the first dice is greater than the number on the second dice, **Player 1** wins.
   - If the number on the second dice is greater than the number on the first dice, **Player 2** wins.
   - If the numbers on both dice are the same, the game is a **draw**.
4. The game will display the result of the dice roll and announce the winner or draw.
5. To play again, simply reload the web page to roll the dice again.
